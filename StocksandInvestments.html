      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">What are Stocks?</h3>
      <p>Stocks are a type of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company. Stocks also are called “equities.”</P>
    </section>
    <section class=MajorTypes>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Major Types of Stocks</h3>
      <p><strong>Common</strong> stockholders entitle owners to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
<strong>Preferred</strong> stockholders usually don’t have voting rights but they receive dividend payments before common stockholders do,
and have priority over common stockholders if the company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated.</p>
    </section>
    <section class=Categories>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Additional Categories</h3>
      <p>Growth stocks have earnings growing at a faster rate than the market average. They rarely pay dividends and investors buy them in the hope of capital appreciation. A start-up technology company is likely to be a growth stock.</p>
      <p>Income stocks pay dividends consistently. Investors buy them for the income they generate. An established utility company is likely to be an income stock.</p>
      <p>Value stocks have a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, meaning they are cheaper to buy than stocks with a higher PE. Value stocks may be growth or income stocks, and their low PE ratio may reflect the fact that they have fallen out of favor with investors for some reason.
        People buy value stocks in the hope that the market has overreacted and that the stock’s price will rebound.</p>
      <p>Blue-chip stocks are shares in large, well-known companies with a solid history of growth. They generally pay dividends.</p>
    </section>
    <section class=Size>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Final Category:Size</h3>
      <p>Another way to categorize stocks is by the size of the company, as shown in its market capitalization. There are large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Shares in very small companies are sometimes called “microcap” stocks. The very lowest priced stocks are known as “penny stocks.” These companies may have little or no earnings.
        Penny stocks do not pay dividends and are highly speculative.</p>

      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">How to Buy and Sell Stocks</h3>
      <p>You can buy and sell stocks through...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A direct stock plan</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Some companies allow you to buy or sell their stock directly through them without using a broker.
              This saves on commissions, but you may have to pay other fees to the plan</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A divident retirement plan</li>
          <ul>
            <li>These plans allow you to buy more shares of a stock you already own by reinvesting dividend payments into the company.
              You must sign an agreement with the company to have this done.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A discount or full-service broker</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Brokers buy and sell shares for customers for a fee, known as a commission.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A stock fund</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These are a type of mutual fund that invests primarily in stocks. Depending on its investment objective and policies, a stock fund may concentrate on a particular type of stock</li>
          <li>Stock funds are offered by investment companies and can be purchased directly from them or through a broker or adviser.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>
      <section class=Bonds>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">What are Bonds?</h3>
      <p>Investors buy bonds because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A bond is a debt security, similar to an IOU. Borrowers issue bonds to
        raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.</li>
        <li>When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal,
        also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it "matures," or comes due after a set period of time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
      <section class=WhyBonds>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Why Bonds?</h3>
      <p>Companies, governments and municipalities issue bonds to get money for various things, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing operating cash flow</li>
        <li>Financing debt</li>
        <li>Funding capital investments in schools, highways, hospitals, and other projects</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
      <section class=TypesBonds>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">TYpes of Bonds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by private and public corporations.</li>
        <li>Investment-grade bonds have a higher credit rating, implying less credit risk, than high-yield corporate bonds.</li>
        <li>High-yield bonds have a lower credit rating, implying higher credit risk, than investment-grade bonds and, therefore, offer higher interest rates in return for the increased risk.</li>
        <li>Municipal bonds, called “munis,” are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other government entities. Types of “munis” include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>General obligation bonds are not secured by any assets; instead, they are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the issuer, which has the power to tax residents to pay bondholders.</li>
            <li>Revenue bonds. Instead of taxes, these bonds are backed by revenues from a specific project or source, such as highway tolls or lease fees.  Some revenue bonds are “non-recourse,” meaning that if the revenue stream dries up, the bondholders do not have a claim on the underlying revenue source.</li>
            <li>Conduit bonds. Governments sometimes issue municipal bonds on behalf of private entities such as non-profit colleges or hospitals. These “conduit” borrowers typically agree to repay the issuer, who pays the interest and principal on the bonds.
              If the conduit borrower fails to make a payment, the issuer usually is not required to pay the bondholders.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>
      <section class=BenefitsBonds>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Benefits of Bonds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bonds can provide a means of preserving capital and earning a predictable return.
          Bond investments provide steady streams of income from interest payments prior to maturity.</li>
        <li>The interest from municipal bonds generally is exempt from federal income tax and also may be exempt from state and local taxes for residents in the states where the bond is issued.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class=RisksBonds>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Risks of Bonds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit risk.  The issuer may fail to timely make interest or principal payments and thus default on its bonds.</li>
        <li>Interest rate risk. Interest rate changes can affect a bond’s value. If bonds are held to maturity the investor will receive the face value, plus interest. If sold before maturity, the bond may be worth more or less than the face value. Rising interest rates will make newly issued bonds more appealing to investors because the newer bonds will have a higher rate of interest than older ones. To sell an older bond with a lower interest rate, you might have to sell it at a discount.</li>
        <li>Inflation risk. Inflation is a general upward movement in prices. Inflation reduces purchasing power, which is a risk for investors receiving a fixed rate of interest.</li>
        <li>Liquidity risk. This refers to the risk that investors won’t find a market for the bond, potentially preventing them from buying or selling when they want.</li>
        <li>Call risk. The possibility that a bond issuer retires a bond before its maturity date, something an issuer might do if interest rates decline, much like a homeowner might refinance a mortgage to benefit from lower interest rates.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class=529>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">What are 529 Plans?</h3>
      <p>A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future education costs. 529 plans, legally known as “qualified tuition plans,” are sponsored by states, state agencies,
        or educational institutions and are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>
    </section>
    <section class=529>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Types of 529 Plans</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans let a saver or account holder purchase credits at participating colleges and universities (usually public and in-state) for future tuition and mandatory fees at current prices for the beneficiary. Prepaid tuition plans usually cannot be used to pay for future room and
          board at colleges and universities and do not allow you to prepay for tuition for elementary and secondary schools.</li>
        <li>Education Savings Plans. Education savings plans let a saver open an investment account to save for the beneficiary’s future qualified higher education expenses – tuition, mandatory fees and room and board. Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts
          can generally be used at any college or university, including sometimes at non-U.S. colleges and universities. </li>
          <ul>
        <li>Education savings plans can also be used to pay up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary for tuition at any public, private or religious elementary or secondary school. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

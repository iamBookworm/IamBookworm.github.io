      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Life Insurance</h3>
      <p>A life insurance policy can provide financial support for your family after your death.
        Money from life insurance can replace your lost income and help pay normal living expenses in addition to medical bills, funeral and burial expenses,
        probate fees (fees associated with determining the validity of a will), and estate taxes.</P>
    </section>
    <section class=Budget>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Term Life: It pays only if death occurs during the term of the policy, which is usually from one to 30 years. Most term policies have no other benefit provisions.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Level term means that the death benefit stays the same throughout the duration of the policy.</li>
            <li>Decreasing term means that the death benefit drops, usually in one-year increments, over the course of the policy’s term.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Whole Life/Permanent Life: Whole life or permanent insurance pays a death benefit whenever the policyholder dies.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of traditional whole life, both the death benefit and the premium are designed to stay the same (level) throughout the life of the policy.</li>
            <li>Universal life, also known as adjustable life, allows more flexibility than traditional whole life policies. The savings vehicle (called a cash value account) generally earns a money market rate of interest.</li>
            <li>Variable life policies combine death protection with a savings account that can be invested in stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds. The value of the policy may grow more quickly, but involves more risk.
               If investments do not perform well, the cash value and death benefit may decrease.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

    <section class=Purchase>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">When Deciding What to Purchase</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add up your normal living expenses, including things such as child care, food, utilities, gasoline, clothing, mortgage payments, rent, and college tuition.
            Consider also the cost of hospital bills, funeral services, and burial if you passed away. </li>
          <li>Estimate the amount of money your family would require each year, and multiply it by the number of years the insurance settlement would be needed.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section class=Where>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Where to Purchase From?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An Insurance Agent</li>
        <li>An Insurance Company</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When buying life insurance, be sure to ask for quotes from at least three companies or agents. It would also be a good idea to request a net cost index from each of them to help you compare policies.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong>Insurance companies often have three price classes, which are based on whether you are a smoker, nonsmoker, or someone with a history of very poor health.</p>

    <section class=FloodIN>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Flood Insurance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Homeowners and Renters’ insurance often don’t cover flooding</li>
        <li>Flood insurance covers direct physical losses from floods and losses resulting from flood related erosion caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels and accompanied by a severe storm, flash flood, abnormal tide surge or a similar situation that results in flooding.</li>
        <li>The maximum flood insurance coverage amount is $250,000 for the structure of the home and $100,000 for the contents of the home. ("Excess" coverage over and above the maximums that are available from NFIP is offered by private insurers.)</li>
        <li>Flood losses for cars are covered under the optional, comprehensive portion of a standard automobile insurance policy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class=Buy>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Buying Flood Insurance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal flood insurance policies can be purchased directly from an insurance professional. Nearly 100 insurance companies write and service NFIP policies.</li>
        <li>Flood insurance covers direct physical losses from floods and losses resulting from flood related erosion caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels and accompanied by a severe storm, flash flood, abnormal tide surge or a similar situation that results in flooding.</li>
        <li>There is a 30-day waiting period before a flood insurance policy takes effect.</li>
        <li>It can be augmented with "excess" insurance – The NFIP policy maximums are inadequate to fully cover some people's assets so a growing number of private insurers have begun offering excess flood policies, intended to provide water damage protection to homeowners over and above the coverage provided by the NFIP policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class=PetIN>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Pet Insurance</h3>
      <p>Similar to Healh Insurance</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic coverage is the least expensive option. Basic coverage provides the lowest reimbursements for procedures, and will help pay for accidental injuries, poisonings and illnesses (including cancer)</li>
        <li>Comprehensive coverage is costlier than basic coverage, but offers more generous benefits, such as reimbursements for accidental injuries, emergencies and illnesses, and coverage for office visits, prescriptions, diagnostic tests, X-rays and lab fees.</li>
        <li>Pet well care protection reimburses for preventive care, including physical exams, flea and heartworm prevention and vaccinations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class=PetIN>
      <h3 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">Renters Insurance</h3>
      <p>Similar to House Insurance</p>
      <p>Includes three key types of financial protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coverage for personal possessions</li>
        <li>Liability protection</li>
        <li>Additional living expenses (ALE)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The additional living expenses portion of your rental insurance policy pays for hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you incur while your rental home is being repaired or rebuilt.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>The big difference is that renters insurance doesn't cover the building or structure of the apartment—that's the landlord's responsibility</p>
